This is an project using Django.

Its a site which is meant to sell electric bikes but could be for anything.
People could reserve the bikes. We take there billing address phone number
and credit card information and mail it to owner without charging the credit card.
Then the owner could ship bike to user and use credit card mnumber to charge
the costomer when ready to ship.

The trying a lot of stuff here to test my django skills and my web development skills,
so some stuff might not be needed for the site but needed to show my Skill.
