# ElectricBikeReserving

This is an e-commerce site using Django as the back end framework.

Its a site which is meant to sell electric bikes but could be for anything.
People could reserve the bikes. We take there billing address, phone number
and credit card information and save the order or pre-order in the databse.
Then the owner could ship bike to user and use credit card number to charge
the costomer when ready to ship.

When a costomer orders a bike they make an account with us so they could look at the orders
at any time or cancel or change address or credit card info.

This site is made not to sell bikes but to collect anough orders for bikes so we the admin could
buy the bikes in bulk from china lets say and when the right amount of orders and made.
Therefore every item is made with a number of orders needed and when the number is meet a
message will be sent to each user to make sure that we they cant back out anymore and we will charge there
credit card and the bike will be shipped th them shortly.

The trying a lot of stuff here to test my django skills and my web development skills,
so some stuff might not be needed for the site but needed to show my Skill.
