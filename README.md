# ElectricBikeReserving

This is an e-commerce site using Django as the back end framework.

Its a site which is meant to sell electric bikes tha I started building for a freind of mine.
ElectricBikeReserving is diffrent that other eCommerce sites since you don't just click and buy, there is a stage
of just reserving the bikes.This site is made not to sell bikes but to collect anough orders for bikes so we the admin could
buy the bikes in bulk when the right amount of orders and made.
Therefore every item is made with a number of orders needed to fulfill that need and when the number is meet a
message will be sent to each user to make sure that we they cant back out anymore and we will charge there
credit card and the bike will be shipped them shortly.

When a costomer orders a bike they make an account with us so they could look at the orders
at any time or cancel an order not yet confirmed or change address or credit card info.

This site has a lot of cool features in it like we save user's shipping addresses and credit cards for future use.
Also there an admin side of the site and an messageing system between the admin site and customer's.
